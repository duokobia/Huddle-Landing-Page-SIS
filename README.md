## My process

When this project was initially done, I had glitches with maintaining the code. Hence, I took some time to learn how a good code structure should look like. A sketch was done and used to approximate the layout and dimensions. Remote git repository was created for the project before development commenced.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first approach 

### What I learned

- I used quite a lot of media queries to obtained a responsive banner.
- Increasing performance gain and controlling design output learnt from:
  https://css-tricks.com/a-guide-to-the-responsive-images-syntax-in-html/
- I am opened to comments about how to improve my frontend skills. 
- There is always something new to learn for dynamic minds.


### Continued development

- The use of CSS framework for future projects such as SASS.
- better naming convention used for future projects such as BEM.
- Media query with advanced website layouts.
- writing cleaner, scalable and easy to maintain code.
